# Network Packet Monitoring using Bettercap
## Project Summary
This project demonstrates network packet monitoring and Man in the Middle (MITM) concepts using Bettercap in a controlled lab environment.
The objective is to understand ARP spoofing, host discovery, and traffic interception basics, which are essential skills for NOC, SOC, and network security roles.
This project was performed strictly in a local lab using virtual machines.
________________________________________
## Objectives
•	Discover live hosts in a local network.
•	Perform ARP spoofing in a controlled environment.
•	Understand how MITM attacks work at a network level.
•	Observe packet flow using Bettercap.
•	Build hands on experience with network security tools.
________________________________________
## Lab Setup
•	Host OS: Windows
•	Virtual Machines:
o	Ubuntu Linux (Attacker – Bettercap)
o	Windows (Victim)
•	Network Type: Host Only / Internal Network (Lab environment)
________________________________________
## Tools Used
•	Bettercap
•	Ubuntu Linux
•	VirtualBox
________________________________________
## Commands Used
### Start Bettercap

sudo bettercap

### Discover live hosts in the network
  
net.show
### Set ARP spoofing targets
  
set arp.spoof.targets <victim_ip>
### Enable ARP spoofing (MITM)
  
arp.spoof on
### Enable packet sniffing
  
net.sniff on

### Note: Packet sniffing was enabled, but no visible traffic was generated by the victim during capture.

## Key Learnings
•	How ARP spoofing works at Layer 2.
•	How attackers can impersonate a router using ARP poisoning.
•	Difference between packet capture and traffic generation.
•	Importance of monitoring abnormal ARP behavior in networks.
•	Why ARP protection mechanisms are critical in enterprise networks.

## Ethical Note
This project was performed only in a private lab environment for educational purposes.
No real networks, public systems, or unauthorized devices were targeted.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of network packet monitoring and MITM attacks.
Bettercap provided hands on exposure to how attackers intercept traffic and how defenders must monitor ARP behavior.
These skills are directly relevant to NOC, SOC, and Network Security Engineer roles.
